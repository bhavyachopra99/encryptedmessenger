# EncryptedMessenger

This is an encrypted messenger which works on python using- 

1) Thingspeak api for sending and receiving messages through json files
2) Tkinter for the gui
3) Fernet for encryption and decryption
4) urlib/request to pull and push url

We have used symmetric encryption in this program.
